Unlock agility and technical excellence to get the best value out of software teams.

I can partner with teams and organisations to:

- **Deliver faster** by identifying constraints, untangling teams and cross-team dependencies
- **Reduce costs** by minimising defects and rework, and improving [legacy code](/legacy-code)
- **Create business value** by enabling experimentation and aligning teams to customers
- **Find joy** in their work by improving productivity and culture, and accelerating learning

I can work both on-site and remote. I am based in Karachi.

# Hands-on engagements

I usually work with small to mid-sized organisations or teams within larger organisations. I work with leaders and engineers to solve problems while simultaneously providing training - so that improvement carries on and endures.

While I work with you, you have my full focus. I work exclusively with one client at a time.

The usual terms are a fixed time contract e.g. 6 months which gives me enough time to get to know the team and company, to identify and solve problems iteratively, and to make a meaningful impact as a coach. The contract is extensible (if it means anything: each of my previous contracts has resulted in an extension).

# Trainings

I have done corporate trainings on Lean/Agile and Extreme Programming (XP) topics in the past e.g.

<img src="/assets/images/services/slicing_workshop.jpg" alt="Story slicing" class="floated-image">

- Flow, wastes, work-in-progress (WIP)
- Test-driven development (TDD)
- Effective pair and mob programming
- Principles such as Tell Don't Ask (TDA), Object Calisthenics, Clean Code
- Refactoring
- Working with legacy code
- Story slicing

I have also done a number of public workshops as host/co-host of Software Crafters meet-ups. Content and recordings can be found [here](https://software-crafters-karachi.github.io/past-meetups).

Trainings are interactive and practical e.g. with the use of activities and coding katas. Learners practice and teach each other 90% of the time. Each training usually lasts two to three hours.

# What people I've worked with say

> We used to work in sprints with long planning cycles and it was Lamak who introduced the concept of flow. Since then, teams have shifted to continuously delivering value to our customers and becoming truly agile. He also ran multiple workshops with operations, business teams, and even the founders to embed this mindset across the company.
> 
> Lamak helped us simplify performance management processes to improve the quality of feedback. He decoupled 360 feedback from appraisals, defined focused criteria for performance and promotions, and guided us in reducing our rating scale to just two points—making the system clear and effective.
> 
> He also established the engineering academy at Bazaar, personally leading the early sessions. Through those sessions and his example, he inspired the entire engineering team to raise the bar and strive for excellence. There is always something to learn from Lamak—he is truly the best at what he does.
> 
> -- Ammar H., Head of Engineering

> Working with Lamak was a genuine delight, both for the quality of work he delivered and for the energy and mentorship he brought. He brings a unique insight into product-first and systems thinking, working on delivering great value to customers while ensuring the engineering standards are kept high through a focus on pair programming and test driven development. I have grown a lot as an engineer working with him, and would very easily recommend him to any organisation looking to improve their processes, their culture and their engineering. Great software is a labour of love, and Lamak helped reignite the joy that makes that labour feel effortless and fun.
