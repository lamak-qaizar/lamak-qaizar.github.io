Get the full value out of software teams by unlocking agility and technical excellence.

I can help teams and organisations:

- **Deliver faster** by identifying constraints, untangling teams and cross-team dependencies
- **Reduce costs** by minimising defects, rework, and improving critical components
- **Create business value** by enabling experimentation and aligning teams to customers
- **Find joy** in their work *again* by improving productivity, culture and learning

I usually work with small to mid-sized organisations or team(s) within larger organisations. I work **hands-on** with leaders and engineers to solve problems while simultaneously providing training so that change is lasting.

While I work with you, you have my full focus. I work exclusively with one client at a time.

I can work both on-site and remote. I am based in Karachi.
