Unlock agility and technical excellence to get the best value out of software teams.

I can partner with teams and organisations to:

- **Deliver faster** by identifying constraints, untangling teams and cross-team dependencies
- **Reduce costs** by minimising defects, rework, and improving critical components
- **Create business value** by enabling experimentation and aligning teams to customers
- **Find joy** in their work by improving productivity and culture, and accelerating learning

I can work both on-site and remote. I am based in Karachi.

# Hands-on engagements

I usually work with small to mid-sized organisations or teams within larger organisations. I work with leaders and engineers to solve problems while simultaneously providing training - so that improvement carries on and endures.

While I work with you, you have my full focus. I work exclusively with one client at a time.

The usual terms are a fixed time contract e.g. 6 months which gives me enough time to get to know the team and company, to identify and solve problems iteratively, and to make a meaningful impact as a coach. The contract is extensible (if it means anything: each of my previous contracts has resulted in an extension).

# Trainings

I have done trainings on XP and Lean topics in the past e.g.

- Flow, wastes in development, work-in-progress (WIP)
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Effective pair and mob programming
- Principles such as Tell Don't Ask (TDA), Object Calisthenics, Clean Code
- Refactoring
- Working with legacy code

Trainings are interactive and practical e.g. with the use of activities and coding katas. Learners practice and teach each other 90% of the time. Each training usually lasts two to three hours.
