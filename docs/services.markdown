Unlock agility and technical excellence to get the best value out of software teams.

I can partner with teams and organisations to:

- **Deliver faster** by identifying constraints, untangling teams and cross-team dependencies
- **Reduce costs** by minimising defects, rework, and improving critical components
- **Create business value** by enabling experimentation and aligning teams to customers
- **Find joy** in their work by improving productivity and culture, and accelerating learning

I usually work with small to mid-sized organisations or teams within larger organisations. I work **hands-on** with leaders and engineers to solve problems while simultaneously providing training - so that improvement carries on and lasts.

While I work with you, you have my full focus. I work exclusively with one client at a time.

I can work both on-site and remote. I am based in Karachi.
