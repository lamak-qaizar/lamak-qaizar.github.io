title:  "What we can learn from airplane crashes"
---
From 1978 to 1988, Korean Air had a plane “loss” rate of 4.79 per million departures.
In contrast, United Airlines had a loss rate of 0.27 per million -- 94% less than Korean Air. 
Pilots in both airlines were as skilled as each other, 
had as many flying hours under their belts, and were flying equally good planes. 
Why did Korean Air then have so many more crashes?

Malcom Gladwell studies the disasters of Korean Air 
and other airlines in a chapter of his book “Outliers”. 
What he finds common is that the causes are overbearingly due to errors in teamwork and communication.

That’s right, planes crash more for social reasons than technical reasons. 
Does any part of this statement sound familiar?

We’ll get back to the question soon. 
First, let’s explore some findings from “Outliers”.

## Planes crash when the pilots don’t communicate effectively

The airline industry realised long ago that having _pilots_ (plural)
onboard significantly reduces the risk of disaster. 
Commercial airlines require at least two pilots. 
Longer flights may require as many as three or four.

They also realised that having two pilots in a cockpit is not enough. 
The pilots must work together. 
Earl Weener, once the chief engineer for safety at Boeing, said:

> For a long time it’s been clear that if you have two people operating the airplane cooperatively, 
> you will have a safer operation than if you have a single pilot flying the plane 
> and another person who is simply there to take over if the pilot is incapacitated.

In case of Korean Air, the first officer 
and flight crew were hesitant to question the captain 
or share direct feedback with them. 
Sometimes they would know something important but would not tell the captain, 
or at least not clearly. 
This lack of collaboration led to seemingly trivial errors.

These errors however added up. 
Malcom Gladwell points out that industrial accidents are, 
on average, the result of a sequence of seven human errors. 
Each error if analysed in isolation might be considered minor and harmless. 
But in combination, they lead to nuclear meltdowns and plane crashes.

Why did the first officers and flight crew of Korean Air 
not communicate clearly with their captain? 
The captain was a superior. 
Korean customs and power dynamics inhibit 
the effectiveness of communication between people of differing ranks. 
Pilots on airlines such as United Air, an American airliner, 
could share feedback with and challenge each other much more freely.

## Planes crash when the most experienced pilot is flying the plane

Malcom Gladwell states that planes are likelier to 
crash when the captain is in the flying seat as compared to 
when the first officer is in it.

Why? When the captain is flying, 
the first officer’s instinct is to assume that the captain, 
the more experienced of the two, is “right”. 
When the first office is flying, 
the captain will not hesitate to correct or 
question the first officer whenever they feel the need to do so.

## Planes crash when the pilots are working under duress

An overwhelming number of crashes occur when flights 
are delayed and the pilots are stretching to meet schedule. 
Even more accidents occur when the pilots are overworked: 
in 52 percent of airplane crashes, 
pilots have been awake for a stretch of 12 hours or more.

Airlines skimp on hotel costs by minimising layovers 
and getting pilots to fly back-to-back flights. 
When pilots are tired, they’re not as sharp as flying a plane needs them to be.

This leads to errors in judgement, and like we saw previously, 
these errors add up. 
The pilots are tired and the weather isn’t great. 
The glide scope, a beam of light to guide the pilot to the runway, 
is out of service. There’s a backup radar, 
but the captain decides to take a visual approach to landing. 
An error in judgement when the weather isn’t great. 
The first office points out the error. Thrice. 
But the message is so subtle, the captain misses it. 
That’s how KAL 801, a Korean Air flight, crashes into the hills, 
killing 228 of the 258 people on board.

When airlines skimp on hotel costs, 
they inadvertently end up losing millions of dollars in lost aircraft, 
tainted reputation, legal costs and more. 
Not to mention the pilots, crew and passengers who never get home.

Back to the question we asked earlier, 
does any part of the following statement sound familiar? 
Planes crash more for social reasons than technical reasons.

If we replace ‘_plane crashes_’ with ‘_problems in software development_’, 
we get the premise of “Peopleware” — a book on managing software projects.

> The major problems of our work are not so much 
> technological as sociological in nature. — Peopleware

When an airplane crashes, a cursory glance might indicate a technical malfunction. 
But investigators don’t settle there — they dig deeper. 
They’ll question what led to the malfunction and this often reveals faults elsewhere, 
e.g. in social constructs.

In software projects, 
we frequently attribute failures to technical errors such as missing tests or alerts. 
Seldom do we question the social constructs that lead to those technical faults.

What are the social constructs that could lead to failures in software projects? 
Let’s look at a few examples.

Are we overworking developers to dangerous levels of utilisation 
like the pilots on back-to-back flights? 
Are we assigning projects and tasks to individuals 
because pair programming (or a co-pilot) would cost us too much? 
Are we shielding our most experienced developers from 
juniors so that they can go faster, much like the captains in the flying seat?

After Korean Air discovered the problems that were plaguing the airline, 
it did turn itself around. Since 1999, the airline has a spotless record 
and is as safe to fly as any other airline in the world.

Is the software industry in need of a turn around?
I don't know. Until we have as elaborate data or investigations of our own, 
maybe we can borrow a lesson or two from the airline industry.
