"Architecture Decision Records" is a light-weight process
for documenting changes to architecture.
They are for architecture what git's commit log is for code.

Below is a simplistic example of an ADR. It also serves as the ADR for this site.

If you are creating an ADR for your team or organisation, 
you can take a more structured approach,
like this one by [Micheal Nygard](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/blob/main/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard/index.md).

- 24-10-2022: Set up GitHub Pages with Jekyll following this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll).
- 30-10-2022: Integrated Google Analytics. Added the script GA provided in `_includes/` and the ID in `_config.yml`.
- 31-10-2022: Removed the GA script from `_includes/`. [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), the theme being used, just required GA ID to be added in `_config.yml`.
- 31-10-2022: Integrated Disqus for comments. Minima has first class support for it. Just need to add a Disqus ID to `_config.yml`.
- 31-10-2022: Disqus doesn't fit well with the theme. Removed it and looking for an alternative.
- 31-10-2022: Integrated [Giscus](https://giscus.app/). It's built using GitHub Discussions, requires a GitHub repo to work, which I have. Minima doesn't support it though out of the box, so have to start looking under the hood now.
  - **Risk:** Seems the post layout isn't extensible, which is where I want to add the comments box. The workaround is to copy [`_layouts/post.html`](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/blob/master/_layouts/post.html) from the Minima theme into my repo and make changes into that file. It's not pretty, and it is a risk that might break future upgrades to the theme :(
- 31-10-2022: Integrated [Applause](https://applause-button.com/), a simple library that will allow readers to like posts
  - Upgraded Minima from v2.5 to v3.0 because the older version doesn't support `_includes/custom-head.html` which is where I need to add the include scripts for Applause.
  - v3.0 is not available as a Gem, so pulling theme from GitHub now. `_config.yml` says `remote_theme: jekyll/minima` now instead of `theme: minima`.
- 31-10-2022: Added custom CSS for the applause button to center it and add top/bottom margins. The css is added to `assets/css/style.scss`.
