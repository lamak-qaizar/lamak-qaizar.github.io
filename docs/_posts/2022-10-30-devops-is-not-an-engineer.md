DevOps is not an engineer. It is a mindset. It is an idea.
One that intends to tear down the walls between developers and operations.

When we throw software over the wall to a “DevOps Engineer” to deploy and run,
we defeat the very idea of DevOps.

To do DevOps right, 
we need to enable developers and operations to work together,
or better yet, enable developers to do operations. 
For the latter to work, 
operational workflows need to be simplified. 
Otherwise, teams may end up reinventing workflows 
or get bogged down by the responsibilities of two expansive domains. 

Having a platform team that enables developers 
to do operational work is a common path organisations take.
To label that team as a "DevOps Team"
or its team members as "DevOps Engineers"
can be considered a minor glitch -- 
a misnomer just calling for the labels to be corrected.
But to throw code over for a "DevOps Engineer"
to deploy, that calls for more to be corrected than just naming.
