DevOps is not an engineer. It is a mindset. It is an idea.
One that hopes to tear down the walls between developers and operations.

When we throw software over the wall to a “DevOps Engineer” to deploy and run,
we defeat the very idea of DevOps.

To do DevOps right, 
we need to enable developer and operations folk to work together,
or better yet, enable developers to do operations. 
For the latter to be effective, 
operational workflows need to be simplified. 
The risk otherwise is that teams will reinvent workflows 
and be bogged down with the responsibilities of two vast domains. 

Having a platform team that enables developers 
to do operational work is a common path organisations take.
If we have a role titled “DevOps Engineer” that does this work,
we haven't wandered too far off the DevOps philosophy.
It's just the name that needs to be corrected.
