DevOps is not an engineer. It is a mindset. It is an idea.
One that hopes to tear down the walls between developers and operations.

When we throw software over the wall to a “DevOps Engineer” to deploy and run,
we defeat the very purpose of DevOps.

To do DevOps right, 
we need to enable developers and operations to work together,
or better yet, enable developers to do operations. 
For the latter to be effective, 
operational workflows need to be simplified. 
The risk otherwise is that teams will reinvent workflows 
or be bogged down by the responsibilities of two vast domains. 

Having a platform team that enables developers 
to do operational work is a common path organisations take.
To label that team as "DevOps Team"
or its team members as "DevOps Engineers"
would be a lesser evil, a misnomer.
It just calls for the labels to be corrected.
But to throw over code for a "DevOps Engineer"
to deploy, there is a lot more to be fixed there.
