> Internal competition has the direct effect of making coaching difficult or impossible. Since coaching is essential to the workings of a healthy team, anything the manager does to increase competition within a team has to be viewed as teamicidal. Here are some of the managerial actions that tend to produce teamicidal side effects:
>
> 1. Annual salary or merit reviews
> 2. Management by objectives (MBO)
> 3. Praise of certain workers for extraordinary accomplishment
> 4. Awards, prizes, bonuses tied to performance
> 5. Performance measurement in almost any form
>
> But hold on here, arenâ€™t these the very things that managers spend much or even most of their time doing? Sadly, yes. And yet these actions are likely to be teamicidal.
