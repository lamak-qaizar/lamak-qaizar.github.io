My reading journey started quite late in life.
I was that kid in the 1990s and 2000s who had not read Harry Potter.
And for much of my early career I was learning by _doing_ --
hacking away with the assistance of friends, Google and Stack Overflow.
I was making (and breaking) things in production.
It was while stepping into a leadership role for the first time that
I felt I could no longer afford to lean as much on trial and error.
So the search began for other means of learning, 
and as the saying goes, seek and ye shall find...

A colleague had left a copy of _Good to Great_ on her desk
(for people like myself to stumble upon).
Jim Collins begins the book by crediting it
to his team of researchers before taking responsibility for any shortcomings.
In awe of Jim Collins humility, I went on to read not only _Good to Great_,
but the entire series.

In a book found on many recommendation lists, _Meditations_,
the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius suggests
that men are born to work together like a man's two hands, feet or eyelids.
To obstruct or fall angry with one another is against Nature's law.
In another oft recommended title, _The Art of War_, Sun Tzu wrote 2000 years ago
that the skillful warrior exploits potential energy,
they do not hold their men responsible. The legendary general wrote:

> On steep ground  
> They move;  
> Square, they halt;  
> Round, they roll.  
> Skillfully deployed soldiers  
> Are like round boulders  
> Rolling down  
> A mighty mountainside.

It is passages like these that got me hooked.
Why falter away on my own when I could be learning
from the wisdom of men who had led armies and empires?
Leo Tolstoy, one of the greatest authors of all time, wrote:

> I cannot understand how some people can live without communicating with the wisest people who ever lived on Earth?

It would not have been a bad idea to have started earlier.
Reading books has been one of the most important takeaways
of the first decade of my professional career.
I have found it to add value not just to how I lead,
but to every aspect in my personal and professional life.

The text above started as an introduction to an article 
compiling the books I have read, however has ended as an article on its own.
I'll follow up with my reading list soon.
