> \[Some organisations\] hold meetings that have little purpose and no clearly defined end-state. At the other extreme, some organisations are so fearful of the waste of meetings that they refuse to use the “M” word at all. This, too, has its downside. The middle is the only safe ground. -- Peopleware

Let's see how we can do meetings right.

There are two types of meetings according to Peopleware: 
ceremonies and working meetings.
How do we know what type a meeting is? If a meeting is ended by the clock,
it is a ceremony. If it is ended by a decision or the completion of some work,
it is a working meeting.

### The ceremony

The purpose of a ceremony is to disseminate information,
e.g. all-hands, stand-ups and alignment meetings.
Good ceremonies call upon the right audience,
have content that is relevant for everyone,
and keep everyone engaged throughout.

Ceremonies are best held sparingly
because nothing actually gets done in them.
For the organisation with too many ceremonies,
Peopleware suggests introducing more focused conversation,
e.g. via one-on-ones, and creating open spaces 
for unstructured interaction
where information can disseminate naturally.

### The working meeting

A working meeting is much harder to get right.
Once we have just the right set of audience in a room,
Rands, in his wonderful book "Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager",
suggests that we add these two critical components:

1. A referee
2. An agenda

The referee keeps the meeting on track
and ensures that everyone is heard.
The agenda defines the format, the objective and the end state.
When the end state is reached, the meeting is ended.

When either a referee or an agenda is missing, 
the odds are stacked up against the meeting for it to be productive.

Rands additionally defines a set of meeting habits
that should be applied to *all* meetings.

1. Designate someone to take notes in the meeting.
2. If this is a recurring meeting, start by reviewing open items from the prior version of this meeting.
3. Close the meeting by repeating the decisions, the issues that remain open, and the owners of those issues.
4. Send the notes from that meeting to the broadest possible set of appropriate humans via a convenient medium after removing confidential or sensitive topics.

He goes on to say:

> If those four bullets don’t feel instinctively the right thing to do
> for every meeting then you’re like me
> for the first decade of my management career when I did none of them.

### One more thing...

Nothing, figuratively speaking,
bothers a knowledge worker as much as a fragmented day.
Paul Graham describes the phenomenon in
"[Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)".
The piece needs no supplement, so I'll only say a little more.

To be productive, knowledge workers must get into
what Peopleware describes as "a state of flow".
Preceding this state is an immersion period of 15 minutes or more,
where one isn't really doing any work.
Any interruption to the state of flow incurs an additional period of immersion.
Knowledge workers thus are most productive when they go
uninterrupted for extended periods of time.

Team Geek suggests managers be mindful of this by scheduling meetings
at other interrupt points of the day, such as lunch or the end of the day.
