*This is a draft*

Value-stream maps can be daunting at first look (have a look at the results of this [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=value+stream+map&udm=2) for instance). They don't need to be. Below is a walk-through of drawing a value-stream map. Once the current state map is complete, we draw a future state map to propose improvements.

I am using Miro to create the map. The notation as well as mapping process is a personal adaptation. Naturally, don't take the methods described here as prescriptive.

The mapping process is conducted in a group setting where everyone that may have information on the value-stream is in a single room (or meeting link if participants are remote).

### Mapping the current state

#### 1. Create a legend

Symbols can be copied from the legend as they are needed in subsequent steps.

#### 2. Map the customer

We place a symbol for the entity for whom we are creating value in the center of our map.

#### 3. Map processes

Followed by mapping out each disjoint process that is carried out to fulfill the customers need. We mention the action in the upper half of our post-it and the actor in the bottom half.

All the processes are listed linearly. Note that we focus on the critical sequence here (i.e. the sequence that dominates delivery time). Parallel steps can be listed if they contribute significantly to the delivery time.

#### 4. Inventory

Preceding each process, add how much work is in progress as well as how much work is waiting to be processed by that step. We call this, all of our unfinished work, our inventory. If it's difficult to come up with a figure, use the inventory at the present moment of mapping.

#### 5. Add process metrics

- Process time is also known as "touch time". This is the time that we are actively working on something.
- Lead time is process time plus all the time that work is waiting to be worked on.
- Percentage complete and accurate (%C&A) is the percentage of times that work is reported as defective by the subsequent process step.

Note that figures need not be very accurate but only indicative of times in the context of the rest of the stream.

#### 6. Add barriers to flow

List down barriers to flow for each process. They indicate why inventory piles up between steps, why process time lags lead time and why defects/rework is reported by the subsequent process.
