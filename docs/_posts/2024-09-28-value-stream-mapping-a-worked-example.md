*This is a draft*

Value-stream maps can be daunting at first look (have a look at the results of this [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=value+stream+map&udm=2) for instance). They don't need to be. Below is a walk-through of drawing a value-stream map. Once the current state map is complete, we draw a future state map to propose improvements.

I am using Miro to create the map. The notation as well as mapping process is a personal adaptation. Naturally, don't take the methods described here as prescriptive.

The mapping process is conducted in a group setting where everyone that may have information on the value-stream is in a single room (or meeting link if participants are remote).

### Mapping the current state

We start by creating a legend on our map. Symbols can be copied from the legend as they are needed in subsequent steps.

We place a symbol for the entity for whom we are creating value in the center of our map.

Followed by mapping out each disjoint process that is carried out to fulfill the customers need. We mention the action in the upper half of our post-it and the actor in the bottom half.

All the processes are listed linearly. Note that we focus on the critical sequence here (i.e. the sequence that dominates delivery time). Parallel steps can be listed if they contribute significantly to the delivery time.
