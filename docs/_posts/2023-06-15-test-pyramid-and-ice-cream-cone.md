The test pyramid makes for an effective testing strategy,
whereas the ice-cream cone is an anti-pattern that 
results in fragile, hard to change, software.
There are many images and variations of the pyramid and ice-cream cone
out there -- I find myself referring back to these by James Shore.
They are from his talk _[Agile without a dedicated QA](https://youtu.be/_Dv4M39Arec)_.
