I recently wrote about how I (belatedly) [started reading books](https://lamak-qaizar.github.io/2023/01/04/how-i-started-reading-books.html).
This is the list of books that I have read since and would pass on as recommendations.
Recommendations is the means by which I have come across most books myself.
I am in gratitude to everyone who has recommended me something to read.

The other means by which I have come across books is the trail 
of references each book leaves behind.
If I liked a book, I have found to usually like the titles it references.
If you are not a regular reader (like myself a few years ago),
finding one book that resonates with you may lead you to another,
then another, then another, and so on.
It won't be long after that one book that you might find yourself reading regularly.

For the lack of a better idea, the title links point to Google.

#### Organisational strategy
- The _[Good to Great](https://www.google.com/search?q=good+to+great+by+jim+collins)_ series. Jim Collins studies why some companies last decades, through recessions, across multiple CEOs and outperform the market. I'd recommend reading _Good to Great_ at the very least. The other titles in the series are superb too but after the second or third book you may start seeing some repeating ideas.
- _[The Art of War](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+art+of+war)_ by Sun Tzu. The translation is only a 30-minute read (commentaries are longer). My copy is by John Minford.
- _[The Leader's Handbook](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+leaders+handbook)_ by Peter Scholtes. Scholtes taught with Dr. Edwards Deming. I read this book particularly for _Chapter 9: Performance without Appraisal_. The rest of the book is as great.

#### People development
- _[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+five+dysfunctions+of+a+team)_ by Patrick Lencioni. Written in the style of novel, it tells the story of an organisation plagued by distrust and conflict and how it turns itself around.
- _[Trillion Dollar Coach](https://www.google.com/search?q=trillion+dollar+coach)_ by Eagle, Schmidt, and Rosenberg. Lessons from Bill Campbell, the coach of Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Sergey Brin etc.
- _[Multipliers](https://www.google.com/search?q=multipliers)_ by McKeown and Wiseman. It was recommended to me by several colleagues. I am passing it on. It tells how some leaders (Multipliers) make those around them smarter whereas others (Diminishers) drain intelligence.
- _[Turn the Ship Around!](https://www.google.com/search?q=turn+the+ship+around)_ by David Marquet. The turn-around story of an underperforming submarine, Sante Fe, and turning followers into leaders.
- _[Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us](https://www.google.com/search?q=drive+surprising+truth+about+what+motivates+us)_ by 
- Training From the Back of the Room!: 65 Ways to Step Aside and Let Them Learn by Sharon Bowman

#### Software engineering
- Agile Technical Practices Distilled by Consolaro and Santos. My go-to book for learning SE techniques like TDD, Refactoring, Code Smells, SOLID and Object Calisthenics. It is concise and includes exercises (katas). A lot of the content for [Software Crafters](https://software-crafters-karachi.github.io/past-meetups.html) meet-ups is borrowed from here.
- The Pragmatic Programmer by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas. One of the first tech books I read. Filled with many memorable anecdotes like the stone soup and broken windows.
- Clean Code by Robert C. Martin. A must-read if you are writing code.
- Refactoring by Martin Fowler. A key skill for software developers. I learnt many new techniques and names for a few I was already using.
- Working Effectively with Legacy Code by Michael Feathers. Defines what is _Legacy Code_ and strategies to go about tackling it. I'd recommend reading at least the first few chapters, and referencing the rest when required.
- Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests by Nat Pryce and Steve Freeman. Walks through the development of an end-to-end application. Very useful for understanding how to apply TDD at all levels of the architecture, i.e. beyond the unit level.
- Release It! by Michael T. Nygard. Strategies for building resilient, scalable and secure production-grade applications
- Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software by Eric Evans and Implementing Domain-Driven Design by Vaughn Vernon. A domain I am still learning about with back-and-forth between these two books. The one by Eric Evans (known as the _Blue Book_) is the original work on DDD, whereas Vaughn Vernon walks us through building an application using DDD principles.

#### Engineering strategy
- Peopleware by Lister and DeMarco. The premise is that the success of software projects depends more on sociological than technical factors. A couple of my favourite chapters are _Teamicide_ and _Competition_. I find myself referring to a lot of other parts of the book as well. 
- Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps
- The Phoenix Project Gene Kim, Spafford, and Behr. A modern rendition of _The Goal_: a manager in an IT company has three months to turn things around or get shut down. 
- The Manager's Path by Camille Fournier. Describes roles and challenges from being a mentee to a CTO and everything in between. The book was consolation for me when I first stepped into an engineering manager role. I realized what I was going through many others have gone through before.
- Smart and Gets Things Done: Joel Spolsky's Concise Guide to Finding the Best Technical Talent by Joel Spolsky. Joel is the creator of Stack Overflow and Trello. Read it if you are hiring.
- Fearless Change by Rising and Manns. Discusses why change is hard and describes patterns for introducing change.
- Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit by Mary and Tom Poppendick
- Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager by Rands
- Dynamic Reteaming: The Art and Wisdom of Changing Teams by Heidi Helfand
- Mythical Man Month by Fred Brooks
- Team Topologies by Manuel Pais and Matthew Skelton
- The DevOps Handbook by Gene Kim, Jez Humble, Debois, and Willis

#### Extreme programming
- Clean Agile by Robert C. Martin. I read this as a refresher for _Agile_. Includes the story of signing of the Agile Manifesto at the Snowbird resort in Utah.
- Extreme Programming Explained by Kent Beck. The original work on XP published in 1999.
- The Art of Agile Development by James Shore. I'd recommend reading this if you want to implement XP in a team. James suggests implementing all the XP rules and practices in concert for a sustained period before going on to adapt them for your circumstances.

#### Lean
- The Goal by Eliyahu Goldratt. Tells the fictional story of a manager who has three months to turn around his flailing factory or get shut down. Brilliant book and a great way to learn about _The Theory of Constraints_.  
- Toyota Kata by Mike Rother. How Toyota built a systematic process for continuously learning and improving.
- Principles of Product Development Flow by Donald Reinertsen. Slightly advanced reading, but highly recommended. It builds on top of lean manufacturing (maybe study lean theory first) with ideas from economics, telecommunication, queueing theory and military science. I am reading it for the second time at the time of writing.
- Toyota Production System by Taiichi Ohno. Taiichi, a manager at Toyota, is considered the father of TPS. This is the story of lean manufacturing in his words.

#### Philosophy
- Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. The personal diary of a Roman Emperor where he penned thoughts on how to live a good life. It is one of the [passages](https://lamak-qaizar.github.io/2022/11/03/when-you-wake-up-in-the-morning.html) from this book that got me studying the stoic school of philosophy.
- Ego is the Enemy, Obstacle is the Way, Stillness is the Key by Ryan Holiday. Other titles by Ryan Holiday may be worth reading too.
- The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday. A short passage for every day of the year. I read it with several colleagues at work.

#### Miscellaneous
Not sure where these titles fall, so adding them here for now.

- Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. A study of how our circumstances influence what we achieve in life. Helped me understand my own journey.
