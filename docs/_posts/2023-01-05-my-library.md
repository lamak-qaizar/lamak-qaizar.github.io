This is a list of books I have read in the first decade of my professional career.
[I started quite late](https://lamak-qaizar.github.io/2023/01/04/how-i-started-reading-books.html)
so most if not all were read in the latter half.
Those included here I would pass on as recommendations,
the means by which I have come across most books myself.
I am in gratitude to everyone who has shared something to read.

The other means by which I have come across books is the trail 
of references each completed book leaves behind.
If I like a book, I have found to usually enjoy the titles it references.
If you are not a regular reader (like myself a few years ago),
finding _one_ book that resonates with you may lead you to another,
then another, then another, and so on.
It won't be long after that first book that you might find yourself reading regularly.

### Organisational strategy
- The **[Good to Great](https://www.google.com/search?q=good+to+great+by+jim+collins)** series. Jim Collins studies why some companies outperform the market, last decades spanning multiple CEOs and get through recessions while others don't. I'd recommend reading _Good to Great_ at the very least. The other titles in the series are superb too but after the second or third book you may start seeing some repeating ideas.
- **[The Art of War](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+art+of+war)** by Sun Tzu. I read it while standing in a bookshop (and purchased it afterwards). The translation is only a 30-minute read, commentaries are longer. My copy is by John Minford.
- **[The Leader's Handbook](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+leaders+handbook)** by Peter Scholtes. Scholtes taught with Deming at W. Edwards Deming Institute. I read this book particularly for _Chapter 9: Performance without Appraisal_ and the rest of the book turned out to be as great.

### People development
- **[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+five+dysfunctions+of+a+team)** by Patrick Lencioni. A leadership fable about an organisation plagued by distrust and conflict and how it turns itself around.
- **[Trillion Dollar Coach](https://www.google.com/search?q=trillion+dollar+coach)** by Eagle, Schmidt, and Rosenberg. Lessons from Bill Campbell, the coach of the likes of Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Sundar Pichai.
- **[Turn the Ship Around!](https://www.google.com/search?q=turn+the+ship+around)** by David Marquet. The turn-around story of Sante Fe, an under-performing submarine, and turning followers into leaders.
- **[Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us](https://www.google.com/search?q=drive+surprising+truth+about+what+motivates+us)** by Daniel H. Pink. Studies where ideas like carrots and sticks come from and why it might be time to think beyond them.
- **[Training From the Back of the Room!: 65 Ways to Step Aside and Let Them Learn](https://www.google.com/search?q=training+from+the+back+of+the+room)** by Sharon Bowman. A couple of key takeaways were not to speak for more than 10 minutes and letting learners teach one another.
- **[Multipliers](https://www.google.com/search?q=multipliers)** by McKeown and Wiseman. It was recommended to me by several colleagues before I finally read it, and it was worth it. It tells how some leaders (Multipliers) make those around them smarter whereas others (Diminishers) drain intelligence.

### Software engineering
- **[Agile Technical Practices Distilled](https://www.google.com/search?q=agile+technical+practices+distilled)** by Marco Consolaro and Pedro M. Santos. Not as well known as others in this list. It is however my go-to book for learning SE techniques like TDD, Refactoring, Code Smells, SOLID and Object Calisthenics. It is concise and includes exercises a.k.a. katas. A lot of the content for [Software Crafters](https://software-crafters-karachi.github.io/past-meetups.html) meet-ups is borrowed from here.
- **[The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+pragmatic+programmer)** by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas. One of the first tech books I read. Filled with many memorable anecdotes like the stone soup and broken windows.
- **[Clean Code](https://www.google.com/search?q=clean+code)** by Robert C. Martin. A must-read if you are writing code and second guessing things like whether variable names should be short or descriptive.
- **[Refactoring](https://www.google.com/search?q=refactoring+by+martin+fowler)** by Martin Fowler. Refactoring is the practice of changing the structure of code without altering behavior (usually to make it easier to add new behaviours). It is an essential skill for software developers given changeability is a key characteristic of software. I learnt many new techniques and names for a few I was already unknowingly using.
- **[Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.google.com/search?q=working+effectively+with+legacy+code)** by Michael Feathers. Defines what is _Legacy Code_ and strategies to go about tackling it. I'd recommend reading at least the first few chapters, and referencing the rest when required.
- **[Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests](https://www.google.com/search?q=growing+object+oriented+software+guided+by+tests)** by Nat Pryce and Steve Freeman. A walk-through of the development of an end-to-end application. Very useful for understanding how to apply TDD at all levels of the architecture, i.e. beyond the unit level.
- **[Release It!](https://www.google.com/search?q=release+it!)** by Michael T. Nygard. Strategies for building resilient, scalable and secure production-grade applications
- **[Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software](https://www.google.com/search?q=domain+driven+design+tackling+complexity+in+the+heart+of+software)** by Eric Evans and **[Implementing Domain-Driven Design](https://www.google.com/search?q=implementing+domain+driven+design)** by Vaughn Vernon. A topic I am still learning about with back-and-forth between these two books. The one by Eric Evans (known as the _Blue Book_) is the original work on DDD, whereas Vaughn Vernon walks us through building a sample application using DDD principles.

### Extreme programming
- **[Clean Agile](https://www.google.com/search?q=clean+agile)** by Robert C. Martin. I read this as a refresher for _Agile_. Includes the story of signing of the Agile Manifesto at the Snowbird resort in Utah.
- **[The Art of Agile Development](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+art+of+agile+development)** by James Shore. I'd recommend reading this if you want to implement XP in a team. James suggests implementing all the XP rules and practices in concert for a sustained period before going on to adapt them for your circumstances.
- **[Extreme Programming Explained](https://www.google.com/search?q=extreme+programming+explained)** by Kent Beck. The original work on XP published in 1999.

### Engineering strategy
- **[Peopleware](https://www.google.com/search?q=peopleware+by+tom+demarco)** by Timothy Lister and Tom DeMarco. The premise is that the success of software projects depends more on sociological than technical factors. A couple of my favourite chapters are _Teamicide_ and _Competition_. I find myself referring to a lot of other parts of the book as well. 
- **[Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps](https://www.google.com/search?q=accelerate+the+science+of+lean+software+and+devops)** by Jez Humble and Nicole Forsgren. A compilation of years of research on what makes high performing teams. It discusses everything from architecture and technical practices to leadership styles and culture. One of my favourite chapters is _Chapter 2: Measuring Performance_ which makes the argument against using story points and velocity to measure performance and proposes alternatives.
- **[The Phoenix Project](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+phoenix+project)** by Gene Kim, Spafford, and Behr. A modern rendition of _The Goal_: a manager in an IT company has three months to turn things around or get shut down.
- **[The Manager's Path](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+managers+path)** by Camille Fournier. Describes roles and challenges from being a mentee to a CTO and everything in between. The book was consolation for me when I first stepped into an engineering manager role. I realized what I was going through many others have gone through before.
- **[Smart and Gets Things Done: Joel Spolsky's Concise Guide to Finding the Best Technical Talent](https://www.google.com/search?q=smart+and+gets+things+done+by+joel+spolsky)** by Joel Spolsky. Joel is the creator of Stack Overflow and Trello. Great read if you are hiring.
- **[Fearless Change](https://www.google.com/search?q=fearless+change)** by Linda Rising and Mary Lynn Manns. Discusses why change is hard and describes patterns for introducing change.
- **[Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit](https://www.google.com/search?q=fearless+change)** by Mary and Tom Poppendick. A brilliant book that borrows ideas from Lean Manufacturing and applies them to software development.
- **[Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager](https://www.google.com/search?q=managing+humans+by+rands)** by Rands. Lessons from Michael Lopp, a.k.a. Rands, an engineering leader who has served Palantir, Apple, Pinterest and Slack. Quite an enjoyable read as the title suggests.
- **[Dynamic Reteaming: The Art and Wisdom of Changing Teams](https://www.google.com/search?q=dynamic+reteaming)** by Heidi Helfand. Patterns for making and breaking teams.
- **[Team Topologies](https://www.google.com/search?q=team+topologies)** by Manuel Pais and Matthew Skelton. Describes how to organise teams for fast delivery of software.
- **[Mythical Man Month](https://www.google.com/search?q=mythical+man+month)** by Fred Brooks. Brooks said in 1975 that adding people to a late software project only makes it later. Sadly he passed away recently (in 2022).
- **[The DevOps Handbook](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+devops+handbook)** by Gene Kim, Jez Humble, Debois, and Willis. Describes the idea and principles behind DevOps. A good accompaniment to _The Phoenix Project_. I particularly like the first few chapters which discuss value stream mapping and the Three Ways -- Flow, Feedback and Continuous Learning.

### Lean
- **[The Goal](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+goal+by+eliyahu+goldratt)** by Eliyahu Goldratt. Tells the fictional story of a manager who has three months to turn around his flailing factory or get shut down. Brilliant book and a great way to learn about _The Theory of Constraints_.  
- **[Toyota Kata](https://www.google.com/search?q=toyota+kata+by+mike+rother)** by Mike Rother. How Toyota built a continuously learning and improving organisation.
- **[Toyota Production System](https://www.google.com/search?q=toyota+production+system+by+taiichi+ohno)** by Taiichi Ohno. Taiichi, a manager at Toyota, is considered the father of TPS. This is the story of lean manufacturing in his words.
- **[Principles of Product Development Flow](https://www.google.com/search?q=principles+of+product+development+flow)** by Donald Reinertsen. Slightly advanced reading, but highly recommended. It builds on top of lean manufacturing (maybe study lean theory first) with ideas from economics, telecommunication, queueing theory and military science. I am reading it for the second time at the time of writing.

### Philosophy
- **[Meditations](https://www.google.com/search?q=meditations+by+marcus+aurelius)** by Marcus Aurelius. The personal diary of a Roman Emperor containing his thoughts on how to live a good life. It is one of the [passages](https://lamak-qaizar.github.io/2022/11/03/when-you-wake-up-in-the-morning.html) from this book that got me studying the stoic school of philosophy.
- **[Ego is the Enemy](https://www.google.com/search?q=ego+is+the+enemy)**, **[Obstacle is the Way](https://www.google.com/search?q=obstacle+is+the+way)**, **[Stillness is the Key](https://www.google.com/search?q=stillness+is+the+key)** by Ryan Holiday. Other titles by Ryan Holiday may be worth reading too.
- **[The Daily Stoic](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+daily+stoic)** by Ryan Holiday. A short passage for every day of the year. I read it with several colleagues at work.

### Miscellaneous
Not sure where these titles fall, so adding them here for now.

- **[Outliers](https://www.google.com/search?q=outliers+by+malcolm+gladwell)** by Malcolm Gladwell. A study of how our circumstances influence what we achieve in life. Helped me understand my own journey.
