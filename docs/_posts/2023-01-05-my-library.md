#### People, strategy and organisations
- The _[Good to Great](https://www.google.com/search?q=good+to+great+by+jim+collins)_ series. Jim Collins studies why some companies last decades, through recessions, across multiple CEO tenures and outperform the rest of the market. I'd recommend reading _Good to Great_ at the very least. The others are superb too, but after the second or third book you may start seeing some repeating ideas.
- _[Multipliers](https://www.google.com/search?q=multipliers)_ by Greg McKeown and Liz Wiseman. It was recommended to me by several colleagues, so I am passing it on here. It tells how some leaders (Multipliers) make those around them smarter whereas others (Diminishers) drain intelligence.
- _[Trillion Dollar Coach](https://www.google.com/search?q=trillion+dollar+coach)_ by Eagle, Schmidt, and Rosenberg. Lessons from Bill Campbell, the coach of Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Sergey Brin etc.
- [The Art of War](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+art+of+war) by Sun Tzu.
