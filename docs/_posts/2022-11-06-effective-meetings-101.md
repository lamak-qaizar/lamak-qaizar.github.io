Peopleware categorizes meetings as either ceremonies or working meetings.
How do we know what type a meeting is? If a meeting is ended by the clock,
it is a ceremony. If it is ended by a decision or the completion of some work,
it is a working meeting.

### The ceremony

The purpose of a ceremony is to disseminate information,
e.g. all-hands, stand-ups and alignment meetings.
Good ceremonies call upon the right audience,
have content that is relevant for everyone,
and keep everyone engaged throughout.

Ceremonies are best held sparingly
because nothing actually gets done in them.
For the organisation with too many ceremonies,
Peopleware suggests introducing more focused conversation,
e.g. via one-on-ones, and creating open spaces 
for unstructured interaction
where information can disseminate naturally.

### The working meeting

A working meeting is much harder to get right.
Once we have just the right set of audience in a room,
Rands, in his wonderful book "Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager",
suggests that we add these two critical components:

1. A referee
2. An agenda

The referee keeps the meeting on track
and ensures that everyone is heard.
The agenda defines the format, the objective and the end state.
When the end state is reached, the meeting is ended.

When either a referee or an agenda is missing, 
the odds are stacked up against the meeting for it to be productive.

Rands additionally defines a set of meeting habits
that should be applied to *all* meetings.

1. Designate someone to take notes in the meeting.
2. If this is a recurring meeting, start by reviewing open items from the prior version of this meeting.
3. Close the meeting by repeating the decisions, the issues that remain open, and the owners of those issues.
4. Send the notes from that meeting to the broadest possible set of appropriate humans via a convenient medium after removing confidential or sensitive topics.

He goes on to say:

> If those four bullets don’t feel instinctively the right thing to do
> for every meeting then you’re like me
> for the first decade of my management career when I did none of them.

### One other thing...

Nothing, figuratively speaking,
bothers a knowledge worker as much as a fragmented calendar.
Paul Graham described the phenomenon in his famous article
"[Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)".

Knowledge workers tend to be most productive in
what Peopleware describes as "a state of flow".
To get into this state, an immersion period of 15 or more minutes is required
where no real work is actually being done.
Any interruption to the state of flow incurs an additional period of immersion.
Knowledge workers thus are most productive when they have
extended periods of uninterrupted time.
