Well, if you are looking for an easy answer, there isn't one. Here is what I've found so far.

## Peopleware

Peopleware lists a set of [management techniques]({% post_url 2022-10-27-teamicidal-management %}) that are detrimental to teamwork. Every one of those is a technique that we're likely to associate with a performance management system. It also quotes Deming:

> Remove barriers that rob people in management and in engineering of their right to pride of workmanship. This means \[among other things\] abolishment of the annual or merit rating and of management by objectives.

It does not say what we should do instead, but highlights the risks of following convention without critical thought.

> Deming’s point is that MBO and its ilk are managerial cop-outs. By using simplistic extrinsic motivators to goad performance, managers excuse themselves from harder matters such as investment, direct personal motivation, thoughtful team formation, staff retention, and ongoing analysis and redesign of work procedures.
> 
> Our point here is somewhat more limited: Any action that rewards team members differentially is likely to foster competition. Managers need to take steps to decrease or counteract this effect.

## The Leader's Handbook

> “If we eliminate performance appraisals, as you suggest, what do we do instead?” Dr. Deming’s reply: “Whatever Peter Scholtes says."

Deming brings us to this wonderful book by Peter Scholtes. The book has a chapter on the very topic in question.

Like Peopleware, The Leader's Handbook also warns us of the perils of traditional performance management systems. And like Peopleware, it doesn't give away any answers either, but it does make a few suggestions.

> When people ask, “If we get rid of performance appraisal, what do we do instead?” my first response is: **“Think differently!”** Behind this somewhat flippant response is the importance of getting rid of the dysfunctional premises. If managers don’t purge these assumptions about the nature of people and work they will not develop true alternative practices, only minor variations on the same theme.

**Think differently!**

That's the first suggestion. The other suggestion is:

> **Just Stop Doing It!** If something is demonstrably the wrong thing to do, if it is harmful to you and others, you don’t necessarily need an alternative in order to cease doing it.

**Just Stop Doing It!**, that's two. And then finally, it suggests the process of **'Debundling'**, i.e. to inspect each element of a performance management system in isolation and to figure out what purpose each serves. If the purpose is important enough to achieve, we can rethink how to achieve that purpose. And if is not important enough to achieve, or is detrimental, we can do away with that specific process. Peter Scholtes describes the process in the form of a flow chart:
