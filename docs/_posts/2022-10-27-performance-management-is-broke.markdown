What should I do instead?

Well, if you are looking for an easy answer, there isn't one. Here is what I've found so far.

## Peopleware

Peopleware lists management techniques that, for the most part, are detrimental to teamwork. Every one of those is a technique that we're likely to find in performance management systems. It also quotes Deming:

> Remove barriers that rob people in management and in engineering of their right to pride of workmanship. This means \[among other things\] abolishment of the annual or merit rating and of management by objectives.

It does not say what we should do instead, but highlights the risks of following convention without critical thought.

> Demingâ€™s point is that MBO and its ilk are managerial cop-outs. By using simplistic extrinsic motivators to goad performance, managers excuse themselves from harder matters such as investment, direct personal motivation, thoughtful team formation, staff retention, and ongoing analysis and redesign of work procedures.
> 
> Our point here is somewhat more limited: Any action that rewards team members differentially is likely to foster competition. Managers need to take steps to decrease or counteract this effect.
