Conventional management is based around the idea of coercion.
When people don't naturally enjoy their work,
conventional management makes sense.
Motivation (or fear?) has to be induced in order to achieve
higher levels of performance.
Methods may include introducing incentive and bonuses, creating competition, 
enforcing KPIs, setting tough goals, managing by objectives (MBO),
and the like.

But what if someone is already motivated by their work?
A case that is common amongst knowledge workers. 
If someone already enjoys doing what they do,
then the need to coerce goes away.
We must instead, as managers, shift our focus
from inducing motivation to getting anything out of the
way that distracts them from doing 
what they already like to do, their work.

Removing distractions that get in the way of work,
i.e. removing the obstacles to flow, 
is one of the objectives of "Systems Thinking",
ideas pioneered by the likes of Deming and Goldratt.
Applying conventional management techniques to
knowledge work is akin to adding distractions and obstacles
to a system and degrading its performance as a result.

Scholtes says:

> How can managers motivate their people? They canâ€™t. Frederick Herzberg established this thirty years ago (1966, 1968). It is the ultimate management conceit to believe that we can motivate people. Motivation is not some substance we can infuse from the outside, like a bone marrow transplant.

> All of our efforts to motivate our people are based on commonly shared myths. Managers can, it is true, demotivate.
