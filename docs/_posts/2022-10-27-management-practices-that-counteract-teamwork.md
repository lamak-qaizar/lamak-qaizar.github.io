The 'icide' suffix indicates the killing of something, 
e.g. pesticide, the killing of pests, 
and homicide, the killing of a person. 
Tom DeMarco, in the context of a team, coined the term "Teamicide".
You can guess what it means.

DeMarco says:

> Internal competition has the direct effect of making coaching difficult or impossible. Since coaching is essential to the workings of a healthy team, anything the manager does to increase competition within a team has to be viewed as teamicidal.

Listed below are a few management techniques that tend to produce teamicidal effects.

> 1. Annual salary or merit reviews
> 2. Management by objectives (MBO)
> 3. Praise of certain workers for extraordinary accomplishment
> 4. Awards, prizes, bonuses tied to performance
> 5. Performance measurement in almost any form

And the irony...

> Arenâ€™t these the very things that managers spend much or even most of their time doing? Sadly, yes. And yet these actions are likely to be teamicidal.
