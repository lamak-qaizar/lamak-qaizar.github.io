Hi there.

I am a programmer and coach with ten odd years of experience.

Early in my career, I was fortunate to be programming at a company that scaled from one server to hundreds. I learnt how to find bottlenecks in architecture and was exposed to a wide array of tools and technologies.

At some point I realised that throwing technologies (and sometimes people) wasn't a very effective way of solving problems. Pains were alleviated maybe, but rarely solved. All the complexity we were piling on - the layers of code, tools, frameworks and people - seemed marvellous, but was it?

I wondered if there was a better way.

Fortune once more smiled upon me as I was introduced to a whole new paradigm of thinking in the form of Lean, Systems Thinking, Theory of Constraints, and of course, Extreme Programming (XP). Thanks in no small part to a colleague I crossed paths with, [Dragan](https://dragan-stepanovic.github.io/), from whom I also learnt the value of a good coach (great in the case of Dragan).

I have since been trying to learn and apply these new ideas (new for me at least, the ideas themselves lend upon many brilliant thinkers of the past like Deming) to make work not only better but to make it joyful for myself and those around me.
