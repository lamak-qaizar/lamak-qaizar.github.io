### Hi there :wave:

I am a programmer and coach with ten odd years of experience.

Early in my career, I was fortunate to be programming at a company that scaled from one server to several hundreds. Besides writing bucket loads of lot of code, I was exposed to a wide array of tools and technologies and learnt how to find bottlenecks in architecture. I also met some fantastic people there from whom I learnt my engineering chops.

At some point I realised that throwing technologies (and sometimes people) wasn't always the most effective way of solving problems. Pains were alleviated maybe, but rarely solved. All the complexity we were piling on - the layers of code, tools, frameworks and people - seemed marvellous, but was it?

I wondered if there was a better way.

Fortune once more smiled upon me as I was introduced to a whole new paradigm of thinking in the form of Lean, Systems Thinking, Theory of Constraints, and of course, Extreme Programming (XP). Thanks in no small part to a colleague I crossed paths with, [Dragan](https://dragan-stepanovic.github.io/), from whom I also learnt the value of a good coach (great in the case of Dragan).

I have since been trying to learn and apply these new ideas (new for me at least; the ideas themselves are lent from many brilliant thinkers of the past, like Taiichi and Deming) to make work not only better but also joyful for myself and those around me.

# Technical skills

I have extensive experience with the following:

- **Python** (and some Django), which was the language of choice at a couple of recent gigs. Also using it as a general purpose language e.g. for scripting and pipelines.
- **Java** (and Spring Framework) at my first job of nearly ten years.
- **AWS services** such as EC2 (including SGs, scaling and the works), Lambda, SQS, RDS, IAM etc.
- **Redis and Elasticsearch** for caching and full-text search respectively
- **Databases** such as MySQL, DynamoDB, S3
- **Containers** i.e. Docker and its ecosystem (e.g. Docker-Compose, ECS)
- **Pipelines** such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions and AWS CodePipeline
- **Logging and observability** using ELK, Grafana/Prometheus, Sentry, NewRelic etc. including leading an SRE team

Not as extensive, but I am familiar with the following:

- **Scala** (with Akka) to build a web app for a data engineering eco system. After working on Java for years, I loved the elegance, and nudge towards functional programming, that Scala offers
- I have worked on projects in **various other languages** e.g. C#, Kotlin, PHP, JS, which I've learnt (and maybe unlearnt :see_no_evil:) as per need. I like to consider myself a polyglot programmer.
- **Airflow** to build data pipelines while I was in a data-ops team

# Practices

- **Extreme Programming** (refactoring, TDD, simple design, evolutionary architecture etc.)
- **Collabrative programming** (pair and mob/ensemble programming)
- **Value-stream mapping** and **Lean** thinking
- **Architecture and design** e.g. Clean Architecture, Code Smells, Object Calisthenics
