### Hi there :wave:

I am a player-coach (programmer-coach to be more accurate) with twelve years of experience.

I started my career programming at a company that scaled from one server (when I joined) to several hundreds. Besides writing bucket loads of lot of code, I was exposed to a wide array of tools and technologies and learnt how to find bottlenecks in architecture. I also met some fantastic people there from whom I learnt my engineering chops.

At some point I realised that throwing technologies (and sometimes people) wasn't always the most effective way of solving problems. Pains were alleviated maybe, but rarely solved. All the complexity we were piling on - the layers of code, tools, frameworks and people - seemed marvellous, but was it?

I wondered if there was a better way.

Around this time, I was introduced to a whole new paradigm of thinking in the form of Lean, Systems Thinking, Theory of Constraints, and of course, Extreme Programming (XP). Thanks in no small part to a colleague I crossed paths with, [Dragan](https://dragan-stepanovic.github.io/), from whom I also learnt the value of a good coach (great in the case of Dragan).

I have since been trying to learn and apply these new ideas (new for me at least; the ideas themselves are lent from many brilliant thinkers of the past, like Taiichi and Deming) to make work not only better but also joyful for myself and those around me.
