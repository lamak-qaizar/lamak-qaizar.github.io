Hi there.

I have been writing code for more than 10 years. Early in my career, I was fortunate to be a part of a company that scaled from one server to hundreds. I learnt how to find bottlenecks in architecture and got exposed to a wide array of tools and technologies.

At some point I realised that throwing technologies (and sometimes people) wasn't a very effective way of solving problems. Pains were alleviated maybe, but rarely solved. Worse still, I was awing myself with all the complexity we were piling on - layers of code, tools, frameworks and people - as if it was something to be marvelled at.

I wondered if there was a better way.

Fortune smiled upon me once more as I crossed paths with [Dragan](https://dragan-stepanovic.github.io/). I was introduced to a whole new paradigm of thinking using Lean, Systems Thinking, Theory of Constraints, and of course, Extreme Programming (XP).

I have since been trying to apply these new ideas (new for me at least, the ideas themselves lend upon many brilliant thinkers of the past like Deming) to make work not only better but to make it joyful for myself and those around me.
