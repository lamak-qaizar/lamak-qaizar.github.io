Some organizations are so addicted to meetings that work has to take the backseat.
A quick and easy solution is to bar meetings during certain hours of the day,
or for entire days, so that people can focus on getting work done.
Plenty of organizations swear by idea, just Google ["no meeting thursday"](https://www.google.com/search?q=no+meeting+thursday).

Me? I get the shivers whenever I hear of the idea. For two reasons:

1. It doesn't solve the underlying problem of why there are so many meetings that people don't find useful in the first place.
2. It assumes *all* meetings are bad, thus blocking critical decisions or discussions that need to take place.

No meeting days feel like a band-aid solution for the lack of better ideas.
If we instead focus on eliminating wasteful practices
that help not only improve the flow of a system, 
but also minimize communication overheads,
we can naturally reduce meetings to only those that really need to happen.

A few examples that illustrate how:
- A product only reaches the customer after passing through several teams. Each handover incurs delays and alignment meetings. By organising teams cross-functionally around the products they build we can eliminate such overheads. 
- A person is allocated to multiple teams. They are unable to focus and have to context switch frequently. Not only that, but there are frequent escalations and meetings between the individual, their teams, and management to get work unblocked. Simply avoiding to allocate one person across multiple teams can fix the problem.
- A team starts work on several stories in parallel. Each story introduces new stakeholders, and each stakeholder wants to know the status of their story. The team is soon overwhelmed just meeting with stakeholders. Constraining work-in-progress (WIP) would ensure the most important things get done. Everything else, including meetings associated with work that doesn't need to happen right now, will be left for until that work is prioritized.
