Some organizations are so addicted to meetings that work has to take the backseat.
A quick and easy solution is to bar meetings during certain hours of the day,
or for entire days, so that people can focus on getting work done.
Plenty of organizations swear by idea, just Google ["No meeting Thursday"](https://www.google.com/search?q=no+meeting+thursday).

Me? I get the shivers whenever I hear of the idea. For two reasons:

1. It doesn't solve the underlying problem of why there are so many meetings that people don't find useful in the first place.
2. It assumes *all* meetings are bad, thus blocking critical decisions or discussions that need to take place.

A 'no meeting day' feel like a band-aid solution.

If we scratch beneath the surface, we may find 
problems that are deeper rooted. 
Are there excessive meetings to do hand-overs, clear dependencies, or align objectives?
Maybe teams are not organised around the flow of value to the customer.
Or is it that the team is meeting one stakeholder after another?
It may be that there are no work-in-progress limits 
and too much work is being released to the team. 

Asking such questions may lead us to more profound answers.
When the underlying problems are fixed,
meetings that don't need to happen, whether right now or at all,
naturally stop happening.
