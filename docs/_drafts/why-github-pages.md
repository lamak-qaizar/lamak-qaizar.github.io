I have written on Medium and LinkedIn in the past.
Unfortunately, I haven't found fluency on either platform.
E.g. since joining Medium in 2018,
my account hosts a grand total of 7 articles.
That is a rate of 1.75 articles published per year.

This is my 7th post on GitHub Pages in 10 days.

Yes, it is unlikely that such a throughput will sustain.
Most of the posts here thus far have been ideas 
I had taken note of, but hadn't found the right platform to share them on.
GitHub Pages has been a sort of release.
Nevertheless, if early signs mean anything, then the signs are, 
at the very least, positive.

Take nothing away from the other platforms,
they are each fantastic in their own right.
I just haven't been able to find my groove on them.

With GitHub Pages, I have felt more in control.
- I host my content.
- I can choose when and whom to share the content with.
- I can release incrementally. There isn't a big bang "publish" button that I have to hit.
- I can write the content as code, on an IDE, on git!
- I can reflect back and find things with ease. It's all in a GitHub repo. Oh, and the content doesn't disappear with time, like on a social media site.
- I don't intend to charge anyone for the content, and I can keep it that way.

There are challenges too.
Features that we take for granted, 
such as stats, reactions and comments, all require custom development.
Nothing extravagant, but it's still not the same as using a ready-to-go platform.
If you don't mind the development, then this isn't necessarily a downside.
It wasn't for me either. It's been an opportunity to learn a few tools I haven't used before
e.g. Jekyll and GitHub Actions.

If you have struggled to write too, don't be too hard on yourself.
It could be many things, one of which is finding the right platform to write on.
As Steve Jobs would say:
