I recently wrote about how I (belatedly) [started reading](https://lamak-qaizar.github.io/2023/01/04/how-i-started-reading-books.html).
This is the list of books that I have read since then and would pass on as recommendations.

For the lack of a better idea, the title links point to Google.

#### Organisational strategy
- The _[Good to Great](https://www.google.com/search?q=good+to+great+by+jim+collins)_ series. Jim Collins studies why some companies last decades, through recessions, across multiple CEOs and outperform the market. I'd recommend reading _Good to Great_ at the very least. The other titles in the series are superb too but after the second or third book you may start seeing some repeating ideas.
- _[The Art of War](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+art+of+war)_ by Sun Tzu. The translation is only a 30-minute read (commentaries are longer). My copy is by John Minford.
- _[The Leader's Handbook](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+leaders+handbook)_ by Peter Scholtes. Scholtes taught with Dr. Edwards Deming. I read this book particularly for _Chapter 9: Performance without Appraisal_. The rest of the book is as great.

#### People development
- _[Multipliers](https://www.google.com/search?q=multipliers)_ by McKeown and Wiseman. It was recommended to me by several colleagues. I am passing it on. It tells how some leaders (Multipliers) make those around them smarter whereas others (Diminishers) drain intelligence.
- _[Trillion Dollar Coach](https://www.google.com/search?q=trillion+dollar+coach)_ by Eagle, Schmidt, and Rosenberg. Lessons from Bill Campbell, the coach of Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Sergey Brin etc.
- _[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+five+dysfunctions+of+a+team)_ by Patrick Lencioni. Written in the style of novel, it tells the story of an organisation plagued by distrust and conflict and how it turns itself around.
- _[Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us](https://www.google.com/search?q=drive+surprising+truth+about+what+motivates+us)_ by 
- Training from the back of the room

It is one of the [passages](https://lamak-qaizar.github.io/2022/11/03/when-you-wake-up-in-the-morning.html) from this book that got me studying the stoic school of philosophy.
