> A value stream is the sequence of activities required to design, produce, and deliver a good or service to a customer, and it includes the dual flows of information and material. -- Value Stream Mapping by Karen Martin and Mike Osterling

Value-stream mapping is a critical step in lean transformations.
John Shook and Mike Rother in _Learning to See_ mention that most waste-reduction activities
fall through because they jump the critical step of mapping the 
end to end value stream first. Although well-intentioned, 
the result is that one part of the stream improves only for
inventory and bottlenecks to emerge in a step downstream.
There are no lasting quality improvements or cost savings without a holistic, 
enterprise-wide, view and approach.

Value-stream mapping comprises the following high-level activities.

1. Map the current state
2. Map the future (desired) state
3. Set goals and execute improvements
4. Repeat

Below we'll focus our attention on creating the current state map.

### The current state map
When mapping out a value-stream, the focus is on the "what", rather than the "how".
Karen Martin and Mike Osterling suggest that if map has more than 15 process blocks,
either the scope is too wide, or the map is getting tangled up 
at the tactical level rather than the strategic level.
Tactical or process-level improvements are beyond the scope of value-stream mapping.

There are two lanes in the map:
1. Top lane that flows right to left (<-): Flow of customer request (e.g. initial request, quote, scheduling work)
2. Bottom lane that flows left to right (->): Flow of work to fulfil the customer request.



Where there is a fork in the stream
- Focus on critical path (the one with the highest lead time)
- Create a separate value-stream if the path is significant
- Create a parallel path in the same stream

### Post-its
- Activity & actors
- Process time, lead time, %C&A
- Barriers to flow
- Information systems
- Push vs. pull
- Inventory

Barriers to flow
"Flow" is the movement of work from one process to the next without interruption or delay.
Activities that impede flow include:
- Batching
- Shared resources or inaccessible staff
- Task switching and interruptions
- Defects and rework


### Summary metrics
- Total process time (PT)
- Total lead time (LT)
- Activity ratio (PT/LT)
- Rolled %C&A

Common problems that current state mapping may reveal:

> - Loop-backs
> - Unnecessary hand-offs
> - Rework due to errors and lack of clarity
> - Batching
> - Functions missing or getting involved too early or too late in the process
> - Redundant activities
> - High variation in how work is performed
> - No documented standard work
> - Excessive inspection (review, approval, audits)
> - Overspecialization of staff
> - Existing technology is not fully leveraged
> - Under-utilization of skills
> - Compliance overkill
> - Delays due to juggling multiple responsibilities
> - Push and overburden
