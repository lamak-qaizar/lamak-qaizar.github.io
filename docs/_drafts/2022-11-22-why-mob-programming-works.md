### Are we underestimating the complexity of writing code?
We must remember to write a failing test first.
Not to refactor in the red.
To refactor when we get to green.
Not to fall into the refactoring rabbit hole.
To keep in mind all the patterns and principles
e.g. SOLID, Object Calisthenics and DRY.
To keep in mind business context.

That is not all of it.
And yet, that is already a lot of things to juggle in our minds when we write code.
Can we expect an individual to do all this?
And do a good job of it?

### Programs must not only work well, they must read well too
Martin Fowler says:
> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand.
> Good programmers write code that humans can understand.

When we mob program, we make no assumptions about whether
the code is easy to understand. For those that have programmed with us, 
it is already understood.

### Flow efficiency vs. individual efficiency
When a task spends less time waiting 
and more time being worked on, we are optimizing for flow.

### It is a natural WIP constraint

Enough said?

### Hyper focus
Add image about focus.
