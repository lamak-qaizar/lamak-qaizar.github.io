### Programming is hard
We must remember to write a failing test first.
Not to refactor in the red.
To refactor when we get to green.
Not to fall down the refactoring rabbit hole.
To keep in mind all the patterns and principles
e.g. SOLID, Object Calisthenics and DRY.
To keep in mind business context.

That is not all of it.
And yet, that is already a lot of things to keep in mind when writing code.
Can we expect an individual to do all this,
and do a good job as well?

### Programs that work well do only half the job

Programs must read well too.

Martin Fowler says:
> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand.
> Good programmers write code that humans can understand.

When we mob program, we make no assumptions about whether
the code is easy to understand. It is already understood.
